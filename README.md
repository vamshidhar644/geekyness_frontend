### Challenges I faced:
Facing the challenge of aligning other angle images within a limited space while ensuring a smooth horizontal scroll was no small feat. However, I successfully resolved this challenge through a combination of HTML and CSS techniques.

I began by creating a parent container with a specific width of 350px and set its overflow property to 'auto' to enable horizontal scrolling. To prevent images from wrapping to the next line, I employed 'white-space: nowrap'. Each image within this container was styled with a maximum width of 100% to ensure they adapt to the container's width while maintaining their aspect ratios. They were also set to display inline-block, guaranteeing a horizontal arrangement.

The result was a sleek and functional image gallery that not only accommodated the limited space but also allowed users to scroll horizontally to view all six images. This solution showcased the power of HTML and CSS in overcoming design challenges and delivering a user-friendly experience.
